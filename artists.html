                  <h2>oasis</h2>
                  <p> Oasis is a British rock band, from Manchester. Formed by brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher and their Manchester mates, Oasis rose to the top of the British charts in the mid-Nineties with its flair for classic psychedelic pop. The Beatles-influenced rock of its debut album, Definitely Maybe (1994), made Oasis overnight pop stars, while the Gallaghers' bravado, open drug use, and general disrespect toward any band that wasn't Oasis earned constant media attention.</p>
